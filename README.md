## Building with Haikuporter

The easiest way to build Swift on Haiku is to use the haikuporter tool to automate the build process and to download the required dependencies listed above.

Setting up haikuporter can be done by following the tutorial under **Setting Up HaikuPorts** hosted on the [wiki](https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports/wiki#setting-up-haikuports).

Once you have setup haikuporter and cloned the ports tree, building swift is as simple as pasting this one-liner in the Terminal:

`haikuporter swift_lang --get-dependencies -G --no-source-packages -j16`

This will build the latest version of Swift though. If you want to build a specific version, then you must pass in the absolute recipe name with the version you want. e.g:

`haikuporter swift_lang-3.1 --get-dependencies -G --no-source-packages -j16`

That's it!

## Building from source manually

This section should be useful to those who wish to develop or to continue fixing stability issues in the swift port. These instructions assume you are running a recent x86_64 nightly. 32 bit Haiku is not supported yet.
	
1. Download the dependencies via `pkgman`.

	`pkgman install llvm17 llvm17_libs llvm17_clang llvm17_libunwind_devel llvm17_lld ninja cmake devel:libedit python3 icu icu_devel devel:libiconv devel:libexecinfo devel:libsqlite3 devel:libgcc devel:libcurl devel:libuuid git pkgconfig`

2. Create a folder to store the swift toolchain:

	`mkdir swift-build && cd swift-build`

3. Clone the `swift-haiku-build` repository: 

	 `git clone https://github.com/return/swift-haiku-build`

### Using the build scripts.

You will find that the repository includes version-specific build scripts and patch files in their respective folders. Below is a short description of what they do:

  *  `build-source.sh` - Points to the master branch and compiles the toolchain from source using the swift-upstream patches for Haiku support.
  *  `build-source-X.Y.sh` - Same as the build-source script but is version-specific and uses version-specific patches for Haiku specific changes. In this case `build-source-3.0.sh` compiles for Swift 3.
  *  `build-script.sh` - The build script commands used to configure and build swift itself.

### Build script options

Whenever a new release or a new tag is out, it is possible to update the port by updating all the repositories and applying the patches automatically. Unless you are using the version-specific scripts 'build-source-X.Y.sh', you just update the tag from the releases page at [apple/swift](https://github.com/apple/swift/tags) and replace it with the newest tag name, usually '*swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-YYYY-MM-DD-a*' in build-source.sh.

Then you run either:
	* `sh ./build-source.sh shallow` - Which performs a shallow clone of the toolchain from the specified tag. Useful if you don't have a fast network connection nor you want to clone the entire commit history or perhaps saves you some disk space.
	* `sh ./build-source.sh full` - Performs a deep clone of the toolchain, with the entire commit history.
	* `sh ./build-source.sh update` - Makes it possible to pull all the newer commits prior to cloning from master. But this will reset any file modifications to prevent conflicts with edited files from HEAD.

You can start the build process by just executing the following commands, with the type of clone depth either **shallow** or **full**, excluding the {} or | characters:

<center>
`sh ./build-source.sh {shallow|full}`
</center>

**_This script is meant to be run on Haiku. Executing the script on other systems may also work, but might still fail to compile (Especially the Swift 3.1 port)_**

 Build the toolchain with this script below, depending if you want a Debug or Release version:


### Release Build

```
./swift/utils/build-script -R --extra-cmake-options='DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=TRUE \ -DCMAKE_SKIP_RPATH=FALSE \
-DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON \ -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86 \ -DLLVM_ENABLE_THREADS=ON \ -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-fPIC \ -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-fPIC' \
--stdlib-deployment-targets=haiku-x86_64 \ -j8
```

### Debug Build

Building a debug version of Swift (with LLVM even in release mode) will take as much as ~30GB
of disk space! You would need to also build with **-j1** when linking debug symbols as using multiple threads, will allocate more memory and exhaust your RAM space quickly when linking occurs.

Follow steps 1-3 and right after the `--stdlib-deployment-targets` argument, append `--debug-swift` to debug the Swift compiler or for debugging the standard library `--debug-swift-stdlib`.

```
 ./swift/utils/build-script -R --extra-cmake-options='-DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=TRUE \
 -DCMAKE_SKIP_RPATH=FALSE -DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86 \
 -DLLVM_ENABLE_THREADS=ON -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-fPIC -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-fPIC' \
 --stdlib-deployment-targets=haiku-x86_64 --debug-swift \
 --debug-swift-stdlib -j1

```

# Developing on the Swift Port

Further development of the swift port is done in various branches in my forks, and knowing where to start can be very confusing or daunting for some. I'll try to explain the branch structure and where all the patches are for this project. This assumes that you are using the forked repositories from [return/swift](https://github.com/return) rather than Apples.

Each repository has the available branches which are as follows:

* swift-3.1-haiku (Deals with Swift 3.1)

* swift-4-haiku-support (Deals with Swift 4.)

* swift-4-haiku-support-upstream (Deals with upstream Swift.)

### Patches for Swift 3.1 support:

Patches related to improving Swift 3.1 for Haiku live on `swift-3.1-haiku`. This branch is also used for building the swift-3.1 recipe at HaikuPorts. If you intend to improve version 3.1 You should switch your branch to `swift-3.1-haiku` like the following structure below:


| Swift               | LLVM                | Clang               | Foundation         | LibDispatch        |  CMark            |
| --------------------| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------|-------------------|
| **swift-3.1-haiku** | **swift-3.1-haiku** | **swift-3.1-haiku** | **swift-3.1-haiku**| **swift-3.1-haiku**|**swift-3.1-haiku**|

_Patches for other repositories not included in the table should be branched out from `swift-3.1-branch` as that is the final release branch for swift 3.1._

### Patches for Swift 4 support:

Patches related to improving Swift 4 on Haiku live on `swift-4-haiku-support`. It also serves at the branch for building the swift-4 recipe at HaikuPorts.  If you intend to improve the Swift 4 port for packaging at HaikuPorts, you should switch your branch to `swift-4-haiku-support` similar to the structure above.


### Patches for upstream Swift:

`swift-n-haiku-support-upstream` (Where n is the version of swift) is meant for sending Haiku related patches to the upstream repositories. A temporary variant of this branch `swift-4-haiku-support-upstream-1` was used in [PR #11583](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11583) for initial support and the workarounds in `swift-4-haiku-support` and  `swift-3.1-haiku` have been removed in both the 'haiku-support-upstream' branches. 

Any patches meant for upstreaming Haiku support _must not_ cause unexpected failures when running tests on other platforms, so please test your changes and be careful when upstreaming!

# Testing

Running tests is similar to the guide mentioned in this [document](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/Testing.md), however the exception here is that these tests don't build position-independent executables by default which clang on Haiku requires. Therefore an extra flag must be passed to the build script to enable -fPIC when linking occurs.

For a list of tests that have failed, they are documented in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/return/6af6bbf84fa507d9ad6043fb593942b7)

### Running the test suite:

The test-suite by appending '-t' for normal tests run via the following command:

`./swift/utils/build-script -R -t ...`

This will test the toolchain and at the end will print the list of failed tests and 
give you a XML representation of the test results.
